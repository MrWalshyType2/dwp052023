# JUnit 5 example

This example will demonstrate using JUnit 5 for Test-Driven Development.

The app will be a simple calculator.

## Features

Calculations upon double precision floating-point numbers.

- Adding two numbers
- Subtracting two numbers
- Multiplying two numbers
- Dividing two numbers 

## Workflow

1. Write test for feature
2. Write just enough code that the app will compile (stubs)
3. Run the failing test
4. Implement the feature
5. Re-run the failing test, if it fails, go back to step 4.
6. Refactor the features implementation, if necessary
7. Re-run the tests after refactoring, go back to step 6 if they fail.
8. Start from step 1, but with a different feature

## Task

Your task will be to use test-driven development to implement the 
multiplication and division features.
